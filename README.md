### Abstract

WAVE / FORM is a generative audiovisual artwork created with Max 8 and Processing. It experiments with the interaction of audio and visual textures, as well as regular and irregular events. The non-interactive artwork is intended to create an immersive and meditative audiovisual experience for its viewer through screen and stereo speaker or headphone. The stereo audio of WAVE / FORM is generated by synthesizers in Max 8, and the visuals are created with Processing. The audio and visual events from the two software communicate and synchronize through OSC. All the events are generated in real time based on a collaboration of periodic and random control signals in both Max and Processing.
